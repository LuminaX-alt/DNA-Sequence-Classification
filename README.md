# DNA-Sequence-Classification
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning pipeline for predicting disease risk from DNA sequences. It starts by generating synthetic DNA sequence data labeled based on a simple pattern. The sequences are converted into one-hot encoded arrays suitable for neural network input.

A deep learning model combining convolutional layers (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is trained to classify the sequences into two classes (e.g., healthy vs. disease). The model learns to extract sequence patterns that correlate with the labels.

Finally, an interactive web interface built with Gradio allows users to input a DNA sequence and receive a predicted disease risk score in real time. This project provides a foundation for genomic data classification and can be extended with real datasets and more advanced models.
